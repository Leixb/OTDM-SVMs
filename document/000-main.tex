% Implement the primal and dual quadratic formulation of the support vector machine in AMPL.

% Apply to a dataset obtained with the accompanying generator.
% Validate the SVM with data different from that of the training set.

% Optionally (but highly recommended for a good mark) you can apply it to other datasets.

% Compute the separation hyperplane from the dual model and check that it coincides with that of the primal model.

% The report must include all the previous elements (AMPL code, results obtained, analysis of results, etc).
