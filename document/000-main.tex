% Implement the primal and dual quadratic formulation of the support vector machine in AMPL.

% Apply to a dataset obtained with the accompanying generator.
% Validate the SVM with data different from that of the training set.

% Optionally (but highly recommended for a good mark) you can apply it to other datasets.

% Compute the separation hyperplane from the dual model and check that it coincides with that of the primal model.

% The report must include all the previous elements (AMPL code, results obtained, analysis of results, etc).

We successfully implemented the primal and dual quadratic formulations of the support vector machine in AMPL.
We applied the model to a training dataset obtained with the accompanying generator and validated
it with a test set.

We also applied the model to the \emph{Ionosphere} dataset and obtained good results.

The computed the separation hyperplane from the dual model coincided with that of the primal model.
However, we had to modify the initial computation of the separation hyperplane to account
for numerical errors.

For the datasets we used, the primal model was significantly faster than the dual model. However,
we did not perform any extensive benchmarking and for larger datasets the dual model should be faster.
