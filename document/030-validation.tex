\chapter{Validation}

To validate our implementation, we
need to apply it to a dataset and measure
the performance of the SVM.

To measure the performance, we will use
\emph{accuracy} on the test set as our metric.

To compute the accuracy in AMPL, we implemented the following
script:
\begin{minted}{ampl}

\end{minted}

\section{Provided dataset}
% Apply to a dataset obtained with the accompanying generator.
% Validate the SVM with data different from that of the training set.

\section{Other dataset}
% Optionally (but highly recommended for a good mark) you can apply it to other datasets.
