\chapter{Formulation}
% Implement the primal and dual quadratic formulation of the support vector machine in AMPL.

\section{Primal}

The primal formulation of the SVM problem is the following:
\begin{align*}
\min_{w,b} & \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 \\
\text{s.t.} & y_i(w^Tx_i + b) \geq 1, \quad i = 1, \ldots, n
\end{align*}
where $w$ is the weight vector, $b$ is the bias, $x_i$ is the $i$-th data point
and $y_i$ is the label of the $i$-th data point.

\subsection{AMPL Model}

We can model this in AMPL as follows:
